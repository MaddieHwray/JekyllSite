subtitle: >-
  Dance is never alone, it's always combined with other elements like music, space, atmospher, technology. 
excerpt: >-
  Looking at dance, it may seem complex and unattainable when only focussing on the body, but dance is so much more than a body. The body is a gateway that opens, intertwines and resonates between the internal and external being and surroundings.

A body that is flexibal and strong. That is what comes to mind when dance comes in however, dance is more than just physical. It is this knowldge that makes dance overlooked as an artform and seen as a discipline. There are other components that are just as important as the body. Dance is magical and irresistible and it should be experienced by all . It is art because it **evokes emotion** within any community or setting that it is involved in. Dance is larger and is connected with deep roots of rythme, beats, melody, emotions, language, culture and tradition. It is a form that breaks down the distinction between what is and isn't suppose to be.

> Dance brings life for oneself as well as others.

As time has passed <a title="Dance" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance" target="_blank">Dance</a> has been progressively presented as a comodity. A means to present works to stay afloat in our economic society and as a result many other componenets are pushed back so the body is all thats left.

There are many components to dance just like there are for drawing, painting, animation and other forms. The body is just the first part that is a compilation of many. Dance is education, emotional and magical. It fills the mind and body with much more than one could possibly imagine. 

Dance moves the body as much as it moves the mind and the heart. If what you are pursuing makes brings all of these together and can bring happieness around the community as well. Then that is an artform. 


> Artforms are expressive.

An artform is something that is an activity that is a medium for imagination and creatives self-expression with which anyone can dive into.
