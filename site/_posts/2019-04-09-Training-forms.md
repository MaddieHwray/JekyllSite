Training the body is extremely important. People train in order to keep the bodies physical abilities as well as to enhance ones knowledge of their feild of study. Dance has many different avenues that a person can take to enhance the mind and body. 


## Codified techniques

ballet is the foundation. **Ballet** is a form that is practiced univeraslly, no matter the country a person travels to. It is the foundations for all other techniques that are practiced today. Ballet is a form that really makes you dive into your body. It is a form that has strucker and predictability which thus allows for the body and mind to aline. When I say that thsi form s universal, this means that it is codifed. Codied means that the structure of the class will follow a pattern. For ballet this means that the class will alwasy start at the bar  with plies and tondus and then will move to the center for jumps. 

[Horton](https://www.dancespirit.com/horton-technique-2326036575.html) is another codified technique that anyone can step into and know what to expect. Horton is a form that is made to emphasizes the anatoical body and approach dance that includes multiple different aspects lie flexibility, strength, coordination and body and spatial awareness to enable unrestricted, dramatic freedom of expression.


Gram is a techniques that is a form of dance that does an amazinf job of building the body for the high demand that is placed on it by the end of the class. This is a form like ballet that has set expersizes and places of structure. The beinning of the class starts with the body on the floor. Through exersies that are taught the body is warmed up part by part. Working from the back, to the arms, legs and feet. Eventually as the exersizes progress the body is ready for it to exiqute jumps, twists and turns. 

Recently I have had the pleasure of being introduced to Gaga. In this the exersizes arent set, but the flow of the class is what makes it a mor ecodified form. Throughout the class everyone is moving along to the prompts that the instructure is giving to the class. This starts with jsuts giving prompts to move the arms. Than there are prompts to start shifting and exploring weight change between two feet. In the middle of the class is when exergy starts to flow and bodies start to move more through space. bt the end of class there should not have been a momenet when there wasn't movement happening. Gaga is a class that is all about continously moving through the body and space. .

## Open techniques

As time progresses, new elements emerge and contemporary is a new form of dance. Contemporary meanign new and that is exactly what has happened. This new way of moving has many different avenues that it can follow. There is the more contemporary movemet that follows allong the modern route like Gram. There are also contemporary fusion type classes. For example contmeporary jazz or hip hop. 
Contemporary is really a form that takes on influence from the instructure. If the teacher has had a more hip hop of ballet background that wil influence the type of class that it is. 
Contemporary is open and has no restraints. The posibilities are endless and there is no wrong way to move or teach it.

Just like how there is no wrong way to do contemporary that is the same for improvisation. Improvisation is exactly how it sounds, it is a class that teaches you how to move your body in space. Improvisation si aform of techniwque that relies on prompts. The teacher will give open ended prompts ,but still specific enough that the class is able to compose their own mvoement and ideas. Improvisations is about letting the mind and body expoler posssibilite within an lose constraint.
