**Nature** One heavy influencer of my dancing and choreography would be from nature around me. I love to take ethe colours, smells and angles that nature produces into my body. I allow this to seep into my body. To imagine what it would be like to be the flow. To see what a baby blue colour does to my body. And what nature does to my senses. How does hearing how the trees sway and the birds chirping feel as I crave the space with this in mind.

## Media
I am constantly reading books and watching movies. There are so many concepts and emotions that arise in their stories line. Movies are the embodiment of what society is feelings and experiencing. Embodying is a big part of my work. What does it feel like to truly be what I am exploring, to truly take an already formed idea and re-morphing it into another new and creative idea. 

## Movements

Lastly, I have been drawing inspiration from social movements. Humansâ€™ rights have always been important to me and now especially with how black lives are being treated. This injustice and blatant ignorance of human rights is appalling and I desire to be a voice that takes out and about this treatment.
