I desire to dive into the concert world of dance. I am looking for opportunities to perform on stage. Being in the light, basking in attention,hopes and desires of the audience is what I live for. I am an artist that loves to dance within a space that is constantly accessable. The thatre is a place that is home. I have grown up in and around it. It is a stable ground that has never given up on me and well as the audience that comes to see performances. The dedication and connect the audience, theatre and dancers have is something extremly prevalent in the concert world and that is what I love. The ability to connect. 

## Choreographer

As I dance, I have come to realize that I love to create dance. Being able to re-imagine and recreate ideas, concpets, thoughts and inspriations that have impacted me and my dance career onto other artists is a trhilling process. The anility to see how others take and percieve my work on the and also to converse with not only the dancers, but also to see how the dacer is able to take what I have given them and see how they present it to an audience. Finally see and hearing how the audience took in my work for this is a crucial part. Getting feedback from the audience and the dancer helps me to grow my artists lenses as a choreogropher.
