  Sustaining the body is a curcial element to a succesful and long career. A career resents on how well and much a person invests into self care. The body is what allows us to move within our space and if it isn't taken care of it won't support us in return.

**Cross training**, 
 
This is extremely important for the body. If the body is continuously being used in the same way day in and out there are bound to be injuries that occur much soon if there is no diversity. Diversity is the key to longevity and that is what many top athletes do in order to stay in the game longer and take care of their bodies. As much as it is important to continuously practice the profession, but this can also lead to one’s downfall.

## Swimming 

One activity that I would highly recommend to take as often as possible would-be swimming. This is something that has very low impact on the body and is an activity that involves almost if not all parts of the body in different was from dance. The legs, arms, head, hands and feet are exerting force, but they are not having to take impact as there isn’t gravity that is being competed with. 

## Yoga + Pilates

Another great cross training activity would be yoga or Pilates. Like swimming it has a lower impact to the body and helps to strengthen and realign parts of the body that are feeling out of place. Yoga helps to stretch and strengthen the muscles through the rhythm of breath and Pilates is made to strengthen the body all round using one’s own body weight.
